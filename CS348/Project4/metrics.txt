 /* Task 2 */

 Q: Why do we not need a reduce operator?
 A: We do not need a reduce operator becuase we are using the SELECT(*) statement which
 	does not require and additional computations to select all from, therefore MapReduce
 	was smart enough to make this a 'map only' operation to save time and space.

Q: What do you observe for cumulative CPU time compared to our queries on the unpartitioned data?
A: The cumulative CPU time on these partitioned table queries are significantly smaller than the ones from task 1 (unpartitioned). 

Q: What do you observe for the wall clock time ("Time taken")? 
A: The wall clock time is about the same, however task 2 was slightly smaller overall--specifically in query 1. 

Q: Why do you think this is?
A: I believe that the partitioned tables make it much faster for the CPU to process (thus resulting in the drastically smaller
   cumulative CPU time) which overall has an effect on reducing the 'wall clock' time. By querying a table on it's partitioned attributes, the resulting CPU time (and likely 'wall clock' time) will be smaller than if it were not partitioned.  I also believe though that since the way that this is querying it still takes relatively the same overall (thus resulting in similar 'wall clock times' of ~20+ seconds) due to the nature of the cluster and MapReduce in combination with these queries.
