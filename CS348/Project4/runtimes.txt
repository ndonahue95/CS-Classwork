Q: How does this runtime compare with our local job?
A: The runtime here is actually larger tha 8x the runtime of the local job! The total time taken
   for this query in HIVE was 26.015 seconds, while the local job ran in just 5 seconds. This 
   proves that for some operations it is best to not utilize the HIVE/cluster method and instead 
   for simpler tasks use local jobs like this intead.
